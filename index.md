## Lab Purpose and Components
Code modules and object methods - especially object deconstruction - were the focus of this lab.

## What I Learned
Object deconstruction was a really helpful tool to use, as objects are very powerful, important, and common in javascript, so it's crucial to have a strong understanding of how to use and manipulate them. Code modules are also really helpful in making sure your code is clean and organized, which is something that is both very useful, as well as being personally important to me as I value tidiness.
